## Examples

Let us first get a feeling about typical use cases of optimization.

### Summary
The four examples we have discussed so far are, actually, quite related.
They all fit into the broad areas of operational research, which and smart manufacturing&nbsp;[@DEPBS2012SMMIADDP; @HPO2016DPFI4S].
The goal of smart manufacturing is to optimize development, production, and logistics in the industry.
Therefore, computer control is applied to achieve high levels of adaptability in the multi-phase process of creating a product from raw material.
The manufacturing processes and maybe even whole supply chains are networked.
The need for flexibility and a large degree of automation require automatic intelligent decisions.
The key technology necessary to propose such decisions are optimization algorithms.
In a perfect world, the whole production process as well as the warehousing, packaging, and logistics of final and intermediate products would take place in an *optimized* manner.
No time or resources would be wasted as production gets cleaner, faster, and cheaper while the quality increases.
