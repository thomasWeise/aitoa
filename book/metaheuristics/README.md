# Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms {#sec:metaheuristics}

Metaheuristics&nbsp;[@WGOEB; @GP2010HOM; @GK2003HOM; @CT2018AITMFO] are the most important class of algorithms that we explore in this book.

\text.block{definition}{metaheuristic}{A *metaheuristic* is a general algorithm that can produce approximate solutions for a class of different optimization problems.}

These algorithms have the advantage that we can easily adapt them to new optimization problems.
As long as we can construct the elements discussed in [@sec:structure] for a problem, we can attack it with a metaheuristic.
In this chapter, we will introduce several such general algorithms.
We explore them by again using the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) from [@sec:jsspExample] as example.
