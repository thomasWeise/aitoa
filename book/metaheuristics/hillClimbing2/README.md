## Hill Climbing Revisited {#sec:hillClimbing2}

Until now, we have entirely relied on randomness to produce new points in the search space.
The results of our nullary, unary, and binary operators are all random.
In case of the unary and binary operator, they of course depend on the input points in the search space fed to the operators, but still, the results are unpredictable and random.
This is, in general, not a bad property.
In the absence of knowledge about what is best, doing an arbitrary thing might have a better expected outcome than doing a fixed, pre-determined thing.

However, it also has some drawbacks.
For example, there is no guarantee to not test the same `1swap` move several times in the `hc_1swap` algorithm.
Also, since we do not know when we have tested the complete neighborhood of a point&nbsp;$\sespel$ in the search space, we also do not know whether&nbsp;$\sespel$ is a (local) optimum or not.
We instead need to guess this and in [@sec:stochasticHillClimbingWithRestarts] we therefore design an algorithm that restarts if it did not encounter an improvement for a certain time.
This might be too early, as there may still be undiscovered solutions in the neighborhood of&nbsp;$\sespel$ &ndash; or it might be too late and we may have already investigated the complete neighborhood several times.

Let us take one step back, to the simple hill climber and the original unary search operator `1swap` for the JSSP from [@sec:hillClimbingJssp1Swap].
This operator tries to perform a single swap, i.e., exchange the order of two job IDs in a point from the search space.
We already discussed in [@sec:hillClimbingWithDifferentUnaryOperator] that the size of this neighborhood is&nbsp;$0.5*\jsspMachines^2*\jsspJobs*(\jsspJobs-1)$ for each point in the search space.

### Idea: Enumerating Neighborhoods {#sec:hc2EnumNeighbors}

Instead of randomly sampling elements from this neighborhood, we could simple iteratively and exhaustively enumerate over them.
As soon as we encounter an improvement, we can stop and accept the better point.
If we have finished enumerating all possible `1swap` neighbors and none of them yields a candidate solution with better objective value (e.g., a Gantt chart with shorter makespan), we know that we have arrived in a local optimum.
This way, we do no longer need to "guess" if we have converged or not, we know it directly.
Also, as detailed in [@sec:appendix:jssp:1swapProb], we should be able to find an improving move faster in average, because we will never redundantly sample the same point in the search space again when investigating the neighborhood of the current best solution.

Implementing this concept is a little bit more complicated than creating the simple unary operator that just returns one single new point in the search space as a result.
Instead, such an enumerating unary operator for a black-box metaheuristic may create any number of points.
Moreover, if one of the new points already maps to a candidate solutions which can improve upon the current best solution, then maybe we wish to terminate the enumeration process at that point.

Such behavior can be realized by following a visitor design pattern.
An enumerating unary operator will receive a point&nbsp;$\sespel$ in the search space and a call-back function from the optimization process.
Every time it creates a neighbor&nbsp;$\sespel'$ of&nbsp;$\sespel$, it will invoke the call-back function and pass&nbsp;$\sespel'$ to it.
If the function returns, say `true`, then the enumeration will be terminated, while it is continued for `false`.
The optimization process, in the call-back function, could apply the representation mapping&nbsp;$\repMap$ to&nbsp;$\sespel'$ and compute the objective value of the resulting candidate solution.
If that solution is better than&nbsp;$\sespel$, it could store it and return `true`.
Otherwise, it would return `false` and be fed with the next neighbor, until the neighborhood was exhaustively enumerated. 

This idea can be implemented by extending our original interface `IUnarySearchOperator` for unary search operations given in [@lst:IUnarySearchOperator]. 

\repo.listing{lst:IUnarySearchOperatorEnum}{A the generic interface for unary search operators, now able to enumerate neighborhoods.}{java}{src/main/java/aitoa/structure/IUnarySearchOperator.java}{}{relevant,enumerate}

The extension, presented in [@lst:IUnarySearchOperatorEnum], is a single new function, `enumerate`, which should realize the neighborhood enumeration.
This function receives an existing point&nbsp;`x`in the search space as input, as well as a destination data structure&nbsp;`dest` where, iteratively, the neighboring points of&nbsp;`x` should be stored.
Additionally, a call-back function&nbsp;`visitor` is provided as implementation Java&nbsp;8-interface [`Predicate`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html).
The [`test` function](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html#test-T-) function of this interface will, upon each call, receive the next neighbor of `x` (stored in `dest`).
It returns `true` when the enumeration should be stopped (maybe because a better solution was discovered) and `false` to continue. 
`enumerate` itself will return `true` if and only if `test` ever returned `true` and `false` otherwise.

Of course, we cannot implement a neighborhood enumeration for all possible unary operators:
In the case of the `nswap`, operator, for instance, all other points in the search space could potentially be reached from the current one.
Enumerating this neighborhood would include the complete search space and would take way too long.
Hence, the [`default`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html) implementation of the new method should just create an error.
It will only be overwritten by operators with a neighborhood sufficiently small for efficient enumeration.
A usual limit is neighborhood whose size grows quadratically with the problem scale, as is the case here, or at most with the third power of the problem scale.

### Ingredient: Neighborhood Enumerating `1swap` Operation for the JSSP {#sec:hillClimbingJssp1SwapEnum}

Let us now consider how such an exhaustive enumeration of the neighborhood spanned by the `1swap` operator can be implemented.

1. Make a copy&nbsp;$\sespel'$ of the input point&nbsp;$\sespel$ from the search space.
2. For index $i$ from $1$ to $\jsspMachines*\jsspJobs-1$ do:
    a. Store the job at index $i$ in $\sespel'$ in variable $job_i$. 
		b. For index $j$ from $0$ to $i-1$ do:
		   i. Store the job at index $j$ in $\sespel'$ in variable $job_j$.
		   ii. If $job_i\neq job_j$ then:
		       1. Store $job_i$ at index $j$ in $\sespel'$.
		       2. Store $job_j$ at index $i$ in $\sespel'$.
		       3. Pass $\sespel'$ to a call-back function of the optimization process.
		          If the function indicates that it wishes to terminate the enumeration, then quit.
		          Otherwise continue with the next step.
		       4. Store $job_i$ at index $i$ in $\sespel'$.
		       5. Store $job_j$ at index $j$ in $\sespel'$.

This simple algorithm is implemented in [@lst:JSSPUnaryOperator1SwapEnum], which only shows the new function that was added to our class `JSSPUnaryOperator1Swap` that we had already back in [@sec:hillClimbingJssp1Swap].

### Hill Climbing Algorithm based on Neighborhood Enumeration

#### The Algorithm {#sec:hillClimbing2Algo}

The new variant of the hill climber would then be able to step-by-step enumerating the neighborhood of the current best point&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\obspel}$ from the search space spanned by a unary operator.
As soon as it discovers an improvement with respect to the objective function, the new, better point replaces&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\obspel}$.
The neighborhood enumeration then starts again from there, until the termination criterion is met.
The general pattern of this algorithm is given below: 

1. Create random point&nbsp;$\sespel$ in search space&nbsp;$\searchSpace$ (using the nullary search operator).
2. Map the point&nbsp;$\sespel$ to a candidate solution&nbsp;$\solspel$ by applying the representation mapping&nbsp;$\solspel=\repMap(\sespel)$.
3. Compute the objective value by invoking the objective function&nbsp;$\obspel=\objf(\solspel)$.
4. Store&nbsp;$\sespel$ in the variable&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\sespel}$ and&nbsp;$\obspel$ in&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\obspel}$.
5. Repeat until the termination criterion is met:
    a. For each point&nbsp;$\sespel'$ in the search space neighboring to the current best point&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\sespel}$ according to the unary search operator do:
    	 i. Map the point&nbsp;$\sespel'$ to a candidate solution&nbsp;$\solspel'$ by applying the representation mapping&nbsp;$\solspel'=\repMap(\sespel')$.
       ii. Compute the objective value&nbsp;$\obspel'$ by invoking the objective function&nbsp;$\obspel'=\objf(\solspel')$.
       iii. If&nbsp;$\obspel'<\bestSoFar{\obspel}$, then store&nbsp;$\sespel'$ in the variable&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\sespel}$, $\obspel'$ in&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\obspel}$, and stop the enumeration (go back to step *5*).
    b. If we arrive here, the neighborhood of&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\obspel}$ did not contain any better solution. So we can stop the algorithm by going to step&nbsp;6.
6. Return best-so-far objective value and best solution to the user.

\repo.listing{lst:HillClimber2}{An excerpt of the implementation of the neighborhood-enumerating Hill Climbing algorithm, which remembers the best-so-far solution and tries to find better solutions by iteratively investigating the solutions in its neighborhood until it finds an improvement.}{java}{src/main/java/aitoa/algorithms/HillClimber2.java}{}{relevant}
 
If we want to implement this algorithm for black-box optimization, we face the situation that the algorithm does not know the nature of the search space nor the neighborhood spanned by the operator.
Therefore, we rely on the design introduced in [@sec:hc2EnumNeighbors], which allows us to realize this implicitly unknown looping behavior (point&nbsp;*a* above) in form of the visiting pattern.
The idea is that, while our hill climber does not know how to enumerate the neighborhood, the unary operator does, since it defines the neighborhood.
The resulting code is given in [@lst:HillClimber2].

We find that this algorithm can quite its main loop early:
If the complete enumeration of the neighborhood of the current best solution $\bestSoFar{\sespel}$ yields no improvement, we can stop.
It makes no sense to enumerate the same neighborhood of the same solution again.
What would make sense here would be to *restart* the search at a different, random point in the search space.

### Hill Climbing Algorithm based on Neighborhood Enumeration with Restarts {#sec:hc2WithRestarts}

The very idea of using an enumerate-able neighborhood was to be able to do restarts more efficiently compared to our original hill climber.
As planned, we are now freed from the need to "guess" when we have to restart.
Instead, we should restart exactly when we have finished enumerating the neighborhood of the current best solution without discovering an improvement. 

#### The Algorithm

1. Set the overall-best objective value&nbsp;$\obspel_B$ to infinity and the overall-best candidate solution&nbsp;$\solspel_B$ to `NULL`. 
2. Create random point&nbsp;$\sespel$ in search space&nbsp;$\searchSpace$ (using the nullary search operator).
3. Map the point&nbsp;$\sespel$ to a candidate solution&nbsp;$\solspel$ by applying the representation mapping&nbsp;$\solspel=\repMap(\sespel)$.
4. Compute the objective value by invoking the objective function&nbsp;$\obspel=\objf(\solspel)$.
5. Store&nbsp;$\sespel$ in the variable&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\sespel}$ and&nbsp;$\obspel$ in&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\obspel}$.
6. If $\bestSoFar{\obspel}<\obspel_B$, then set&nbsp;$\obspel_B$ to&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\obspel}$ and store&nbsp;$\solspel_B=\repMap{\sespel}$.
7. Repeat until the termination criterion is met:
    a. For each point&nbsp;$\sespel'$ in the search space neighboring to the current best point&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\sespel}$ according to the unary search operator do:
    	 i. Map the point&nbsp;$\sespel'$ to a candidate solution&nbsp;$\solspel'$ by applying the representation mapping&nbsp;$\solspel'=\repMap(\sespel')$.
       ii. Compute the objective value&nbsp;$\obspel'$ by invoking the objective function&nbsp;$\obspel'=\objf(\solspel')$.
       iii. If&nbsp;$\obspel'<\bestSoFar{\obspel}$, then store&nbsp;$\sespel'$ in the variable&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\sespel}$, $\obspel'$ in&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\obspel}$, and stop the enumeration (go back to step&nbsp;*6*).
    b. If we arrive here, the neighborhood of&nbsp;$\bestSoFar{\obspel}$ did not contain any better solution. Hence, we perform a restart by going back to point&nbsp;2.
6. Return **best ever encountered** objective value&nbsp;$\obspel_B$ and solution&nbsp;$\solspel_B$ to the user.

\repo.listing{lst:HillClimber2WithRestarts}{An excerpt of the implementation of the Hill Climbing algorithm with restarts based on neighborhood enumeration.}{java}{src/main/java/aitoa/algorithms/HillClimber2WithRestarts.java}{}{relevant}

Different from [@sec:hillClimberWithRestartAlgo], this new algorithm does not need to count steps or even manage a parameter regarding how often to restart.
Its implementation in [@lst:HillClimber2WithRestarts] is therefore also shorter and simpler than the implementation of the original algorithm variant in [@lst:HillClimberWithRestarts].
It should be noted that both new hill climbers can only be applied in scenarios where we actually can enumerate the neighborhoods of the current best solutions efficiently.
In other words, we pay for a potential gain of search efficiency by a reduction of the types of problems we can process.

: The results of the neighborhood-enumerating hill climber with (`hc2r_1swap`) and without (`hc2_1swap`) restarts in comparison with the "original" hill climbers from [@sec:hillClimbing]. The columns present the problem instance, lower bound, the algorithm, the best, mean, and median result quality, the standard deviation&nbsp;*sd* of the result quality, as well as the median time *med(t)* and FEs *med(FEs)* until the best solution of a run was discovered. The better values are **emphasized**. {#tbl:hc2VsHc1Jssp}

In [@tbl:hc2VsHc1Jssp], we compare this new neighborhood-enumerating hill climbers (prefix `hc2`) with the "original" hill climbers from [@sec:hillClimbing].

We find that the non-restarting variant `hc2_1swap` from [@sec:hillClimbing2Algo] outperforms `hc_1swap` except for instance `la24`.
We can also see that it can require several seconds (3s for `abz7` and 24s for `swv15`) until it arrives in a local optimum from which it can no longer escape with `1swap` moves.

`hc2r_1swap` is the algorithm version with restarts, i.e., once it finds a point in the search space whose neighborhood, given in [@sec:hc2WithRestarts].
It performs better than its non-enumerating counterpart `hcr_256+5%_1swap` and sometimes also than `hcr_256+5%_nswap` which was the best original hill climber due to its `nswap` operator with a larger neighborhood (see [@sec:jsspUnaryOperator2]).

The improvements are small, but they are there.
